Here's my python practice projects
# Qiana's Python Portfolio
This repository contains examples of Python I've written for learning. 
#Below are a few highlighted projects, including data visualizations I created using Tableau. Feel free to take a look around and [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amymartikabrown/) if you have any feedback or questions.


In this dashboard, I used a Tableau dataset containing sample sales data from 2018 to 2021. Though the sample dataset provides a wider overview of sales data, I saw an opportunity to strategically visualize clear, actionable insights to my fictional audience of sales executives. The dashboard allows my audience to immediately pinpoint the geographical, categorical, and seasonal factors that are leading to profit loss â€” providing the guided insight that allows them to impact change on their team.

### World Happiness Rankings Dashboard - [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amymartika/viz/WorldHappinessReport_16737679931360/WorldHappinessReport)
- **Data:** [World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness)
- **Audience:** Anyone interested in geography & culture
- **Purpose:** Explore and interact with visualized world happiness data

The World Happiness Report dataset ranks the happiness of 155 countries from 2015 to 2019. For this dashboard, I wanted the audience to be able to dive deeper into countries around the world and gain a contextual understanding of where those countries rank against the world average. The dashboard allows the user to explore the world map and compare metrics across countries. I'm endlessly interested in world geography and cultural nuances, so I created a dashboard that gets right to the information points I would most want to play with.
