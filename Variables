'''Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.'''
# example 1
x = "challenging"
def myfunc():
  print("Seeking a job as international graduate is " + x)
myfunc()
  
''' example 2

def myfunc():

  x = "fantastic"

'''example 3

x = "awesome"
def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)
myfunc()
print("Python is " + x)
