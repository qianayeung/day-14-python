t Value via Pandas
You are given a dataframe with a single column, 'var'.

Calculated the t-value for the mean of ‘var’ against a null hypothesis that 
μ=μ0

Note: You do not have to calculate the p-value of the test or run the test.

Example
Input:

mu0 = 1
print(df)
...
   var
0  -34
1   40
2  -89
3    5
4  -26

t-value formula: t = (sample_mean - population_mean) / (sample_standard_deviation / sqrt(sample_size))
= (((df.mean() = mean of the DataFrame df = sample mean)) - (mu0 = population mean) )/ [(df.std() = standard deviation of the DataFrame df = sample standard deviation)
/ [(pow(df.count(), 1/2) = square root of the sample size = (number of observations))]
